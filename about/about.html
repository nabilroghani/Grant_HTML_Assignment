    <h2>Junaid jamshed</h2>
    <p>Junaid Jamshed Khan (Urdu: جنید جمشید خان;[3] 3 September 1964 – 7 December 2016) was a Pakistani former
      singer-songwriter, television personality, fashion designer, actor, engineer, and Islamic preacher. Jamshed first
      gained nationwide and international recognition as the vocalist of Vital Signs. Their 1987 album, Vital Signs 1
      included the hit singles "Dil Dil Pakistan", and "Tum Mil Gaye". The commercial success of the album helped
      develop Pakistan's rock music industry.

      In 1994, he released his debut solo album, Junaid of Vital Signs followed by Us Rah Par in 1999 and Dil Ki Baat in
      2002. In 2004, Jamshed left both his engineering and music careers and, afterwards, focused on his religious
      activities for Islam and reciting nasheeds on TV and releasing them on CDs. Jamshed also owned a clothing boutique
      with the name "J." (read as "Jay Dot"), which has several outlets throughout Pakistan and some abroad.

      In November 2014, Jamshed was accused of blasphemy and in December 2014, in a video message, he apologized for
      offending people and making mistakes.[7][8]

      Junaid Jamshed and his wife died on 7 December 2016 when PIA Flight 661 crashed in Havelian. The flight was en
      route to Islamabad from Chitral. He was in Chitral for a Tablighi Jamaat mission and was returning to
      Islamabad.[9][10]</p>
