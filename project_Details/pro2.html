      <p>Zarar is not just a fragrance; itâ€™s a statement. Intense, bold, and magnetic, this perfume is crafted for the
        fearless spirit. It opens with spicy top notes of black pepper and cardamom, leading to a smoky heart of leather
        and dark woods. Base notes of patchouli and vetiver ground the scent in a mysterious, earthy depth. Zarar is the
        perfect companion for daring adventures and those who thrive on standing out from the crowd.</p>
