    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>It all started with an outlet at Tariq Road in 2002. At that time, Tariq Road was, and still is, a shopping hub
      for those who seek to buy the latest in fashion. Initially, only men's wear was available at the store, but later
      on clothing for women, children, teens, as well as formal wear including groom's wear was also added to the
      product list as expansion continued. In 2011, we took another bold initiative and gave a new look to all our
      outlets as part of our â€˜New Outlook, New Outlet' strategy. This broke the monotonous theme of our outlets by
      making them more modern and different from others.</p>
    <h3>Corporate Philosophy</h3>
    <p>The main idea behind launching J. (J dot) was to reintroduce traditional clothes in Pakistan with a blend of
      modernism. For this purpose, we initiated with reworking on our Eastern dresses, especially Qameez Shalwar and
      made them contemporary with the latest elaborations available. The experimentation with this rare combination
      resulted in an increased interest of people toward modified Eastern ensembles, which will always be in vogue.</p>
    <h3>Brand Personality</h3>
    <p>J. can be defined as a fashion retail brand that is rich, elegant and stylish in traditional ensembles. It keeps
      adding seasonal clothes, machine prints, intricate embroidery and modern cuts to its already extensive collection
      on a regular basis. For our unique and flamboyant designs for men and women, we depend on a team of highly skilled
      fashion professionals who come from the country's renowned fashion institutes. They start out by studying the
      latest trends, carrying out research on how these trends can be adopted, selecting the colors and styles that can
      make the collection extraordinary and then finalizing both casual and formal designs for every season.</p>
    <h3>Innovation</h3>
    <p>Though the philosophy behind establishing J.Was ti revive our traditional Qameez Shalwar. the aspect of adding a
      modern touch to them is what makes this brand exclusive. This rare combination of blending tradition with the
      latest fashion trends is itself innovative as it give rise to astonishingly amazing designs. This makes the brand
      a trend setter in the fashion industry. For impeccable finesse. we use state-of-the-art technology for weaving our
      own fabric Handlooms are used for Khaadi and Jacquard fabric while power looms are used for the plait fabric. All
      dyeing, printing and weaving is done by us. <a href="https://www.junaidjamshed.com/about-us-1"
