        <dt><b>Janan Gold</b>
        <dd>JANAN Eau de Perfume / 100 ml JANAN by J. is being specially introduced to freshen up the wearer, the finest
          ingredients were hand-selected for this composition. It has the effect of romance, gallantness and genteel
          spirited up. The perfect accord of leathery appeal, with the chypre musky effect and the rejuvenating
          fruitiness make it an enticing choice for the virile.

          The top notes are a tantalizing citrus splurge of bergamot, black currant, red apple and pineapple. This leads
          to the floral heart of jasmine, rose with patchouli and birch. The musky base of oak moss and amber is laid on
          the creamy vanilla base. <a href="../Blog/pro1.html">More Details</a></dd>
